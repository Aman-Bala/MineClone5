Hopper=
Hoppers are containers with 5 inventory slots. They collect dropped items from above, take items from a container above and attempts to put its items it into an adjacent container. Hoppers can go either downwards or sideways. Hoppers interact with chests, droppers, dispensers, shulker boxes, furnaces and hoppers.=
Hoppers can be disabled by supplying them with redstone power. Disabled hoppers don't move items.=
To place a hopper vertically, place it on the floor or a ceiling. To place it sideways, place it at the side of a block. Remember you can place at usable blocks (such as chests) with sneak + right-click. The hopper will keep its orientation when the blocks around it are changed. To access the hopper's inventory, rightclick it.=
