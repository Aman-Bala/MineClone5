Note Block=
A note block is a musical block which plays one of many musical notes and different intruments when it is punched or supplied with redstone power.=
Use the note block to choose the next musical note (there are 24 half notes, or 2 octaves). The intrument played depends on the material of the block below the note block:=
• Glass: Sticks=
• Wood: Bass guitar=
• Stone: Bass drum=
• Sand or gravel: Snare drum=
• Anything else: Piano=
The note block will only play a note when it is below air, otherwise, it stays silent.=
