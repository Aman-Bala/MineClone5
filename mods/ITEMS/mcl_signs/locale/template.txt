Sign=
Signs can be written and come in two variants: Wall sign and sign on a sign post. Signs can be placed on the top and the sides of other blocks, but not below them.=
Place the sign at the side to build a wall sign, place it on top of another block to build a sign with a sign post.@nAfter placing the sign, you can write something on it. You have 4 lines of text with up to 15 characters for each line; anything beyond these limits is lost. The text can not be changed once it has been written; you have to break and place the sign again.=
