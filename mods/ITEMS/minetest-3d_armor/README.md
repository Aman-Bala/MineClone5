Modpack - Armor
==================

[mod] Visible Wielded Items `[wieldview]`
-----------------------------------------

Makes hand wielded items visible to other players.

Note: Currently only supports 16x16px texture packs, sorry!

[mod] Visible Player Armor `[mcl_armor]`
----------------------------------------

Adds craftable armor that is visible to other players. Each armor item worn contributes to
a player's armor group level making them less vulnerable to weapons.

Armor takes damage when a player is hurt, however, many armor items offer a 'stackable'
percentage chance of restoring the lost health points.
