Beds allow you to sleep at night and make the time pass faster.=
To use a bed, stand close to it and right-click the bed to sleep in it. Sleeping only works when the sun sets, at night or during a thunderstorm. The bed must also be clear of any danger.=
In local folklore, legends are told of other worlds where setting the start point for your next life would be possible. But this world is not one of them.=
By using a bed, you set the starting point for your next life. If you die, you will start your next life at this bed, unless it is obstructed or destroyed.=
In this strange world, going to bed won't skip the night, but you can skip thunderstorms.=
Sleeping allows you to skip the night. The night is skipped when all players in this world went to sleep. The night is skipped after sleeping for a few seconds. Thunderstorms can be skipped in the same manner.=
